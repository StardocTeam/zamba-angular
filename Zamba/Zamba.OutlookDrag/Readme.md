# Outlook File Drag

*Drag and drop Outlook items as files into any application*

## Overview

Outlook File Drag is an add-in for Outlook 2013 and 2016 that allows you to drag
and drop Outlook items (messages, attachments, contacts, tasks, appointments, 
meetings, etc) to applications that allow physical files to be dropped, such as
web browsers.

## How Does it Work?

When you try to drag and drop from Outlook, Outlook correctly identifies the 
format as virtual files (CFSTR_FILEDESCRIPTORW) since the files do not exist 
directly on disk.  Instead, they are contained in a PST file, OST file, or on 
an Exchange server.

However, many applications do not support this format, such as web browers and 
most .NET/Java applications.

To work around this issue, Outlook File Drag hooks the Outlook drag and drop
process and adds support for physical files (CF_HDROP).  When the receiving 
application asks for the physical files, the files are saved to a temp folder 
and those filenames are returned to the application.  The application processes
the files (such as uploading them).  Outlook File Drag deletes the temp files 
later in a cleanup process.

## Features

- Works with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and other applications that accept files to be dropped
- Allows drag and drop into HTML5-based web applications
- Drag e-mails, attachments, contacts, calendar items, and more
- Drag multiple items at once
- Supports Unicode characters
